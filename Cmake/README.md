In CMake, the keywords `INTERFACE`, `PRIVATE`, and `PUBLIC` are used to control how include directories, compile definitions, and linked libraries are **propagated** from one target to others. These keywords define the *visibility* or *scope* of the settings you're applying to a target.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of each:

---

### ‚úÖ `INTERFACE`

* Applies only to consumers of the target, **not the target itself**.
* Used mostly in **interface libraries** (e.g., `add_library(Foo INTERFACE)`).
* The target doesn't compile or link anything; it just carries usage requirements (include paths, compile flags, linked libraries).

**Example:**

```cmake
target_include_directories(MyTarget INTERFACE path/to/include)
```

* `MyTarget` will not use `path/to/include`, but any target that links to `MyTarget` will.

---

### ‚úÖ `PRIVATE`

* Applies **only to the target itself**, **not** to anything that links to it.

**Example:**

```cmake
target_include_directories(MyTarget PRIVATE path/to/include)
```

* Only `MyTarget` will use `path/to/include`; nothing that links to `MyTarget` will.

---

### ‚úÖ `PUBLIC`

* Applies to both the **target itself** and any targets that link to it.

**Example:**

```cmake
target_include_directories(MyTarget PUBLIC path/to/include)
```

* `MyTarget` uses the include path, and so do all targets that link to it.

---

### üß† Use Case in Your Example

```cmake
add_library(OpenCVInterface INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(OpenCVInterface INTERFACE ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(OpenCVInterface INTERFACE ${OpenCV_LIBS})
```

* This defines a **pure interface library** (it has no compiled code).
* It's a wrapper for passing OpenCV's usage requirements (include directories and link libraries) to other targets that consume it.
* Any target that does:

  ```cmake
  target_link_libraries(MyApp PRIVATE OpenCVInterface)
  ```

  will **inherit OpenCV's includes and link libraries**.

### Summary Table

| Keyword     | Used by Target | Propagated to Dependents |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| `INTERFACE` | ‚ùå              | ‚úÖ                        |
| `PRIVATE`   | ‚úÖ              | ‚ùå                        |
| `PUBLIC`    | ‚úÖ              | ‚úÖ                        |

# Next Question:
```
is there anything else other than that list?
```

Yes, while `INTERFACE`, `PRIVATE`, and `PUBLIC` are the most commonly used **access specifiers** in CMake for properties like include directories, compile options, and link libraries, there are a few other related keywords and concepts worth knowing. Here's a broader picture:

---

### üîë Common Access Specifiers

| Keyword     | Description                                                                           |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `INTERFACE` | Used **only by consumers** of the target. The target itself doesn‚Äôt compile anything. |
| `PRIVATE`   | Used **only by the target itself**. Not passed to anything linking to it.             |
| `PUBLIC`    | Used **by the target itself and its consumers**.                                      |

---

### üìå Other Related Keywords / Concepts

#### 1. **`IMPORTED`**

* Used with `add_library()` or `add_executable()` to declare a **pre-built external target**.
* You don't define how it's built; you just declare its existence.

```cmake
add_library(Foo STATIC IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(Foo PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_LOCATION /path/to/libfoo.a
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES /path/to/foo/include
)
```

---

#### 2. **`ALIAS`**

* Creates an alternate name for an existing target. Can be used to simplify usage or namespace a library.

```cmake
add_library(MyLib::Core ALIAS CoreLib)
```

---

#### 3. **`SYSTEM` (with `target_include_directories`)**

* Marks headers as "system headers" to suppress warnings from them (useful for third-party libraries).

```cmake
target_include_directories(MyTarget SYSTEM PUBLIC /some/external/include)
```

---

#### 4. **`GENERIC`, `MODULE`, `OBJECT`, etc. (in `add_library`)**

* These are *types* of libraries, not visibility keywords, but they change how libraries are built or used:

| Library Type | Purpose                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `STATIC`     | Compiled into the target at link time            |
| `SHARED`     | Dynamically linked (.so/.dll)                    |
| `MODULE`     | Loaded at runtime, not linked at compile time    |
| `OBJECT`     | Only compiles object files, no final library     |
| `INTERFACE`  | No build output; only carries usage requirements |
| `IMPORTED`   | Pre-built external target                        |

---

#### 5. **`target_sources()` with `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`, `INTERFACE`**

* Controls how source files are added and who sees them.

```cmake
target_sources(MyLib
  PRIVATE mylib.cpp
  PUBLIC  mylib_api.cpp
  INTERFACE mylib_interface.hpp
)
```

---

### üîç Bonus: Generator Expressions

In CMake, **generator expressions** like `$<CONFIG:Debug>` or `$<TARGET_PROPERTY:prop>` often show up in advanced uses. They dynamically evaluate based on the build configuration or target properties and are commonly used inside `target_link_libraries()` or `target_compile_options()`.

---

If you're managing dependencies, interfaces, or configurations in a CMake project, knowing the above concepts gives you solid control over build behavior. Let me know if you‚Äôd like visual examples or sample CMake projects using these!

### Next Question

```
no I'm asking about this: add_library(Foo STATIC IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(Foo PROPERTIES
    IMPORTED_LOCATION /path/to/libfoo.a
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES /path/to/foo/include
)
```

Ah, I see ‚Äî you're asking specifically about this CMake pattern:

```cmake
add_library(Foo STATIC IMPORTED)
```

Let‚Äôs break it down in detail ‚Äî including what `STATIC`, `SHARED`, and `IMPORTED` mean **in this context**.

---

## üîç `add_library(Foo STATIC IMPORTED)`

You're **declaring** a **precompiled library** that exists outside of your build system ‚Äî you're not building it yourself. Here's what each part means:

### ‚öôÔ∏è `IMPORTED`

* This tells CMake: *"I'm not building this library; it already exists somewhere else on disk."*
* You **must** specify where the library is located using `IMPORTED_LOCATION`.

### üß± `STATIC`

* This tells CMake: *"The external library is a static library."*
* CMake knows how to link it: it will pass the `.a` or `.lib` file to the linker.

So, this line:

```cmake
add_library(Foo STATIC IMPORTED)
```

Means: *"Define a static library target named `Foo` that is externally built."*

---

### üîó Then You Must Define Where the Library Lives

```cmake
set_target_properties(Foo PROPERTIES
  IMPORTED_LOCATION /path/to/libfoo.a
  INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES /path/to/foo/include
)
```

* `IMPORTED_LOCATION`: Path to the actual `.a` (or `.lib` on Windows).
* `INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`: Include path(s) that should be used when other targets link to `Foo`.

---

## ‚úÖ You Can Use Other Types Too

You can also do this for a **shared** library:

```cmake
add_library(Foo SHARED IMPORTED)
set_target_properties(Foo PROPERTIES
  IMPORTED_LOCATION /path/to/libfoo.so
  INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES /path/to/foo/include
)
```

Or use `UNKNOWN` if you don't care whether it's static or shared:

```cmake
add_library(Foo UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
```

> `UNKNOWN` lets you set the path later, which is useful in platform-dependent code where the library type might differ.

## üìå Summary of `add_library(<name> <type> IMPORTED)`

| Keyword     | Meaning                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `STATIC`    | The imported lib is a `.a` or `.lib` (no runtime dependency)   |
| `SHARED`    | The imported lib is a `.so`, `.dll`, or `.dylib` (runtime dep) |
| `MODULE`    | It's a runtime-loaded plugin-style library                     |
| `INTERFACE` | No actual library file, just usage info (like include dirs)    |
| `UNKNOWN`   | Type is unknown or determined later                            |
| `IMPORTED`  | Library is prebuilt and won't be built by this project         |
